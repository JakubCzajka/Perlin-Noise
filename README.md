# Perlin-Noise
Program that generates and applies perlin noise as opacity layer to image.
As of now, the noise generation in both C++ and ASM works, and the progrem displays generated noise correctly.

Further functionality (setting noise patameters and setting it as opacity layer for images) will be added soon.
